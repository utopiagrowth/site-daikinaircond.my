 * Availability label + tappable phone number for the header and footer.
 *
 * The number is DB-sourced (`getDisplayPhone`), never a literal, so it cannot
 * drift from what is seeded in `phone_numbers` and a CMS change reaches the
 * chrome on a `webcore-phones` tag purge without a rebuild.
 *
 * Lead ROUTING is untouched: every WhatsApp CTA still goes through
 * /redirect-whatsapp-1, which resolves per request and honours leads_mode. Only
 * this display element bypasses attribution — a tap-to-call is not tracked,
 * which is the cost of showing the number at all.
 *
 * Styling lives in globals.css (see contact-number.css in this folder), not a
 * styled-jsx block: this element is passed into the client SiteHeader as a
 * prop, so styled-jsx scoping in that component would not reach it.
